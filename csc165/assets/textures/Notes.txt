using black hole and space station:

black hole: sphere
	black was the front half of the sphere with the outside colors all together at the back
	a black marble with an orange back side
lesson: center of the image is on one end of the sphere and the corners are on the opposite side

space station: torus
	green portion is a small loop around the doughnut on the far side with the long grey parts going all the way around the long outside of the loop
	blue and grey striped doughnut with a green band tied around the far side
lesson: the y center line of the image is the inside of the torus

planet: sphere
	looks as it should (similar to Jupiter with a cold cap)
lesson: noticeable seam on the left side where the left and right edges of the texture do not line up. Colors must line up, to the pixel, on original texture to avoid seam 

cold planet: torus
	stripes of color along the outer face of the doughnut
lesson: noticeable seam on the right side where the left side of the texture (closest to start view) meets right side of texture. Very top of texture is at the far, top of the doughnut. difficult to see seam on inside of doughnut because texture lines up properly somehow.

black hole: torus
	center of image focused on far, bottom of doughnut. seam confirmed goes in loop around part of doughnut. one corner of image appears smeared across entire front, outside of doughnut. se

NOTE: 
tage does not give an error if you have the wrong texture name in the code, it opens the java window and simply fails to load anything
	may want to add a try-catch statement to fail the program out if the file name isn't found
		TextureImage class in tage calls Engine.getRenderSystem.addTexture
			tage/RenderSystem line 434
		try-catch may fit there better
